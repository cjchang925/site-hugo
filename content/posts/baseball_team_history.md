# The Origin of the Team
### Freshman Cup

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, NYCU holds Freshman Cup for all freshmen to play sports games together. On 2021 Fall semester, several classmates and I signed up for the baseball games of the cup, representing our department. Although we did not win the championship in the end, we still enjoyed playing baseball together and hoped our baseball dream would not stop with the Freshman Cup. The cup sowed a seed of the team, and the story continued.

### Deciding to Take Action
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firstly met one of my best friend, Lorenzo Yu, in a practice of the varsity baseball team. After the Freshman Cup, he and I both withdrew from the varsity team due to some reasons. Then, however, we had no more ball games to play and no teammates to practice together, which made us disappointed. In fact, Lorenzo asked me whether we should establish a department team several times. At first, I was not sure about how to build a team and whether we would succeed. However, my thoughts completely changed after watching other department teams practicing. I bagan to imagine what our team should look like in the future, and that was exactly the key that made me resolve to take action to make my dream come true.
